subtitle: About this site

First and foremost, this site is a shameless plug for myself. Being a MBA candidate with Computer Science undegrad, I have dabbled between the business side and technical side during my career. It can be hard to articulate my mixed skill-set in the CV, apart from the old cliche line of "liason between business and technolgy"; so I thought it might be easier to demonstrate my technical knowledge by building this site (using GitHub Pages and beautiful-jekyll), and write about my business knowledge.
