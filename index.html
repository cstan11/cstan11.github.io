subtitle: About this site

First and foremost, this site is a shameless plug for me. Being an MBA candidate with Computer Science undergrad, I have dabbled between the business side and the technical side during my career. It can be hard to articulate my mixed skill-set in the CV, apart from the old cliche line of "liaison between business and technology"; so I thought it might be easier to demonstrate my technical knowledge by building this site (using GitHub Pages and beautiful-jekyll), and write about my business knowledge.
